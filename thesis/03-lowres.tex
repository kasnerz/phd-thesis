\chapter{Low-Resource Data-to-Text Generation}
\label{chap:low-res}


In this chapter, we introduce three approaches for low-resource \ac{d2t} generation based on \acp{plm}. By \emph{low-resource}, we mean using as little data as possible for generating fluent and accurate text. We develop approaches that leverage the general-domain pretraining of \acp{plm} in order to generate texts in domains with thousands, hundreds, or even zero training examples.

The data we focus on are \acs{rdf} (\Acl{rdf}) triples from factual knowledge graphs and meaning representations in dialogue systems. The main feature of these kinds of data is that we always want to verbalize the whole input. For larger data, we would need a separate content selection component, but our approaches are generalizable to other kinds of data which fulfill this requirement.

The simplest setting, presented in \autoref{sec:finetuning}, consists of finetuning a pretrained transformer encoder-decoder model. For finetuning the model, we need approximately thousands of in-domain examples. We show that this baseline is powerful, achieving competitive results on a shared task for generating knowledge graph descriptions. On top of that, we show that this approach generalizes to other languages than English, namely Russian.

In \Cref{sec:iterative,sec:pipeline}, we then present approaches which can generate texts with even \emph{more limited amount} of in-domain training examples. Our key idea is to use a \ac{plm} only as a tool for improving text fluency \emph{regardless of the content}, and delegating (possibly crude and basic, but factually correct) verbalization of the content to other, simpler tools. \autoref{sec:iterative} shows an approach using a text-editing model trained on iteratively fusing simple templates, which has a limited vocabulary focused on sentence fusion. The limited vocabulary and training objective pushes the model towards generating factually correct sentences. In \autoref{sec:pipeline}, we also add an ordering and aggregation step for generating more fluent texts. For each of these steps, we can train a \ac{plm} entirely on general-domain operations, reducing the need for in-domain examples to zero.

\label{sec:finetuning}

\begin{refbox}
    This section is based on the paper \emph{Train Hard, Finetune Easy: Multilingual Denoising for RDF-to-Text Generation} \cite{kasnerTrainHardFinetune2020}, joint work with Ondřej Dušek, published in the Proceedings of the 3rd International Workshop on Natural Language Generation from the Semantic Web (WebNLG+) at INLG 2020.
\end{refbox}


In this section, we introduce a simple approach for generating knowledge graph descriptions. Our approach is based on finetuning a multi-lingual \ac{plm} on linearized graphs and the accompanying human-written descriptions from the WebNLG dataset. In the WebNLG+ Shared Task, our model placed in the first third of the leaderboard for English and first or second for Russian on automatic metrics, and in the best or second-best system cluster on human evaluation.

\subsection{WebNLG+ Shared Task}
\label{sec:webnlgp}
The WebNLG Challenge 2020\footnote{\url{https://synalp.gitlabpages.inria.fr/webnlg-challenge/challenge_2020/}} (WebNLG+; \citealp{ferreira20202020}) was the second edition of the shared task in graph-to-text generation. The task was based on the WebNLG dataset, which contains subgraphs from the DBpedia knowledge graph. Each subgraph is described by a set of \ac{rdf} triples and accompanied with crowdsourced text descriptions (see \autoref{sec:datasets}). On top of the original challenge \cite{gardentWebNLGChallengeGenerating2017}, WebNLG+ included a separate track of generating texts in Russian, in which we also participated.


\subsection{Problem Formulation}
\label{sec:mbart}
Our input is a set of \ac{rdf} triples $x \in X$, where each triple $x = (s, p, o)$ describes the relation $p$ between the entities $s$ and $o$ in the knowledge graph. Our target output $Y$ is a fluent and semantically accurate natural language description of $X$.


We formulate the task as \emph{sequence-to-sequence} generation. First, we linearize the input sequence in the default order. We select two arbitrary separator tokens: one to delimit the contituents of the triple and another to delimit individual triples. Using the linearized sequence as an input and the target text, we finetune a pretrained encoder-decoder model using the cross-entropy objective (see \autoref{sec:transformer}). We use the finetuned model to generate the target texts using autoregressive decoding (see Algorithm~\ref{alg:decoding}).

% 


\subsection{Implementation}
\paragraph{Data Preprocessing} We use the provided XML WebNLG data reader\footnote{\url{https://gitlab.com/webnlg/corpus-reader}} to load and linearize the triples. For each triple, we use the \texttt{flat\_triple()} method which converts each triple into the ``\texttt{s $\vert$ p $\vert$ o}'' string, using a pipe (``$\vert$'') as a separator. We use another token not present in the training data (``$\blacktriangleright$'') for delimiting individual triples to avoid extending the model vocabulary.\footnote{Our choice of the separators is arbitrary, as we will adapt the model to account for our separators.
    % Works such as \TODO{cite} or \TODO{cite} show that the choice of separators is not important.
} We linearize the triples in their default order. For the input to the model, we tokenize the data using SentencePiece tokenizer \citep{kudo2018sentencepiece} trained on the training dataset, using a vocabulary of 250,000 subword tokens.

\paragraph{Model}
We use mBART \cite{liuMultilingualDenoisingPretraining2020}, a multilingual \ac{plm} based on BART, a transformer model pretrained on text denoising (see \autoref{sec:plms}).
% In pretraining, the noise function of mBART replaces text spans of arbitrary length with a mask token (35\% of the words in each instance) and permutes the order of sentences. 
The model uses 12 layers for the encoder and 12 layers for the decoder ($\sim$680M parameters), and it is pretrained on the large-scale CC25 corpus extracted from Common Crawl, which contains data in 25 languages \citep{wenzek2020ccnet}.



\paragraph{Training} We finetune the pre-trained \texttt{mbart.CC25} model from the \textsc{fairseq} toolkit \citep{ott2019fairseq} using the default parameters.\footnote{We use dropout 0.3, attention dropout 0.1, and 1024 tokens per batch. We set the initial learning rate to 0.0003 and use polynomial decay with 2500 warmup steps. We train the model using the Adam optimizer \cite{kingma2014adam} with $\beta_1=0.9, \beta_2=0.98$ and $\varepsilon=1e-06$. For the full setup, see \url{https://github.com/facebookresearch/fairseq/tree/main/examples/mbart}.} We change the total number of updates from 40k to 10k to reflect the smaller size of our data. We train a separate version of mBART for each language: $\text{mBART}_{\text{en}}$ on English inputs and English outputs, and $\text{mBART}_{\text{ru}}$ on English inputs and Russian outputs.

\end{table*}

We report on WebNLG automatic and human evaluation results, as well as our own error analysis.

\paragraph{Automatic Metrics}
The results of our approach for English are shown in \autoref{tab:mbart:results-en}, comparing to the baseline.
% \footnote{See \url{https://gerbil-nlg.dice-research.org/gerbil/webnlg2020results} for full results.} 
We can see that our approach beats the baseline in all metrics and places in the first third of the submissions. While it does lose performance on unseen categories, the drop is not as dramatic as for many other competing approaches.

The results for Russian are shown in \autoref{tab:mbart:results-ru}. There were fewer submissions for Russian, and our system not only beats the baseline by a large margin (as did all competing submissions), but it is able to rank first in 2 metrics out of 4 (BLEU, BERTScore) and second in the remaining ones.

\paragraph{Human Evaluation}

The challenge organizers ran a human evaluation campain, where annotators were asked to rate the texts for data coverage, relevance, correctness, text structure and fluency.  Each criterion has been rated with a number in the range from 0 (completely disagree) to 100 (completely agree). The scores were clustered into groups (1-5; 1 being the best) among which there are no statistically significant differences according to the Wilcoxon rank-sum test \citep{wilcoxon1992individual}.

Our systems placed in the top clusters (1 or 2) for both English and Russian. For English, our $\text{mBART}_{\text{en}}$ system ranks first for all the categories in \textit{seen domains}, and first or second in \textit{unseen entities} and \textit{unseen domains}. In total, our English system achieved rank 1 for relevance, correctness and text structure, and rank 2 for data coverage and fluency. For Russian, our $\text{mBART}_{\text{ru}}$ system ranks second for correctness and first in all other categories.

\end{table*}

\paragraph{Manual Analysis}
To better understand the nature of errors made by our system, we manually inspected a sample of 50 outputs in each language.\footnote{Automatic back-translation to English was used to facilitate understanding of Russian.} We found factual errors in 12 English outputs, mostly concentrated along the unseen categories (\emph{Scientist}, \emph{Movie}, \emph{Musical Record}). The model tends to describe musical works and movies in terms of written works (“written”, “published” etc.), i.e., the closest seen category. There are also several swaps in roles of the entities (e.g., “is to southeast” instead of “has to its southeast”, “follows” instead of “is followed by” etc.).

In a few cases, the model hallucinates a relation not specified in the data (e.g., “born on January 1, 1934 in Istanbul” when a date of birth and current residence is given, not the birthplace) or is not able to infer background knowledge not given on the input (it talks about a dead person in the present tense).
% The swaps in roles and hallucinated relations also occured in Russian; in addition, we found a hallucinated (correct) airport name and a few forgotten ingredients for a dish from a long list. 
Factual errors in Russian were less frequent (9 sentences), which is expected as there are no unseen categories. Moreover, the system shows an impressive performance at translating entity names from the English \ac{rdf} into Russian.

We further found 10 outputs with suboptimal phrasing in English and 9 in Russian, where the model did not connect properties of the same type in a coordination (e.g., two musical genres for a record) or gave numbers without proper  units (e.g., “runtime of 89.0” or “area of 250493000000.0”).

\paragraph{Discussion}
Our solution benefits from the pretrained representations of the mBART model. Multilingual pretraining allows us to use a single architecture for both English and Russian. However, English and Russian are the two most represented languages in the mBART pre-training corpora (ca. 300 GB of data each) and the performance of our model would probably be lower with low-resource languages.

The performance of our model is also noticeably lower on categories unseen in training, and it is prone to swapping relations of entities or hallucinating relations. Even though the longest examples in the WebNLG dataset fit into the model, the length of the input sequence is still limited and the model does not generalize for inputs of arbitrary size.





\section{Iterative Sentence Fusion}
\label{sec:iterative}

\begin{refbox}
    This section is based on the paper \emph{Data-to-Text Generation with Iterative Text Editing} \cite{kasnerDatatoTextGenerationIterative2020}, joint work with Ondřej Dušek, published in the Proceedings of the 13th International Conference on Natural Language Generation (INLG 2020).
\end{refbox}

We present an approach for generating semantically accurate texts from structured data in low-resource settings. Our approach builds on a text-editing model trained on the task of \emph{sentence fusion}. We first transform individual data items to text using trivial templates, and iteratively improve the resulting text using the sentence fusion model, filtering, and re-ranking.  Our approach gets lower scores on lexical similarity metrics on WebNLG and E2E datasets than the state-of-the-art approaches; however, it achieves high levels of semantic accuracy due to the limited scope of the sentence fusion model and guaranteed presence of the entities. We also demonstrate that our task formulation opens up the possibility for zero-shot \ac{d2t} generation by training a model on a general-domain dataset for sentence fusion. The code for the experiments is available on Github.\footnote{\url{https://github.com/kasnerz/d2t_iterative_editing}}


\subsection{Motivation}
\label{sec:text-editing}
Our goal is to improve the semantic accuracy \ac{d2t} generation. Other works have pursued this goal, e.g., by adapting the decoding algorithm \cite{tianStickingFactsConfident2020}, improving robustness of the model by injecting noise in its hidden states \cite{kedzie_good_2019}, or self-training with a natural language understanding model \cite{nieSimpleRecipeReducing2019}. Our approach is inspired by the systems which use a \emph{generate-then-rerank} approach \citep{dusekSequencetoSequenceGenerationSpoken2016,juraska_deep_2018}, e.g. using a classifier \cite{harkousHaveYourText2020}, to filter incorrect outputs.

To generate outputs with sufficient semantic accuracy for the filtering step, we take advantage of three facts: (1) we can lexicalize individual data items using trivial templates, (2) concatenating the lexicalizations tends to produce an unnatural sounding but semantically accurate output, and (3) a \ac{plm} trained on improving the output fluency can be used for combining the lexicalizations.

% \textsc{LaserTagger} \cite{malmi2019lasertagger}, which we use in our approach, is a sequence tagging model based on the transformer architecture with BERT \cite{devlinBERTPretrainingDeep2019} as the encoder backbone. Other recent text-editing models without a pre-trained backbone include EditNTS \citep{dong} and Levenshtein Transformer \citep{gu2019levenshtein}.

% Concurrently with our work, \citet{kale2020few} explored using templates for dialogue response generation. %\ODdel{Unlike our work,} 
% They use the sequence-to-sequence T5 model \citep{raffel2019exploring} to generate the output text from scratch instead of iteratively editing the intermediate outputs, which leaves less control over the model.


\subsection{Method}
\label{sec:text-editing-exp}
We focus on data structured as \ac{rdf} triples.\footnote{Later, we also trivially extend our approach to key-value pairs.} In our approach, we start from single-triple templates and iteratively fuse them into the resulting text while filtering and reranking the results. We first detail the main components of our system (template extraction, sentence fusion, \ac{plm} scoring) and then give the overall description of the generation algorithm.

\begin{figure*}[t]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/d2t_text_editing}
    \caption{A single iteration of our algorithm for iterative \ac{d2t} generation. In Step 1, the template for the triple is selected and filled. In Step 2, the sentence is fused with the template. In Step 3, the result for the next iteration is selected from the beam by filtering and language model scoring.}\label{fig:iterative:alg}
\end{figure*}



\paragraph{Template Extraction}
We collect a set of templates for each unique predicate. We use two approaches: (a) handcrafting the template manually for each predicate in the training set, and (b) automatically extracting the template from the lexicalizations of the examples  in the training set. For unseen predicates, we add a single fallback template: \textit{The <predicate> of <subject> is <object>.}


\paragraph{Sentence Fusion}
We train a model for the task of \emph{sentence fusion}, i.e., combining sentences into a coherent text \cite{barzilay2005sentence}.
%We train an independent in-domain sentence fusion model for each dataset. 
To construct the training data for the model, we select pairs of examples $(X, X')$ and their corresponding text descriptions $(Y, Y')$ from the original training set such that the examples consist of $(k, k+1)$ triples and have $k$ triples in common. This leaves us with an extra triple $x_{k+1}$ present only in $X'$. For each training example, we use the concatenated sequence $Y \mathrm{lex}(x_{k+1})$ as a source and the sequence $Y'$ as a target, where $\mathrm{lex}(x_{k+1})$ denotes lexicalizing the triple $x_{k+1}$ using an appropriate template.
As a result, the model learns to integrate $Y$ and $x_{k+1}$ into a single coherent expression.


\paragraph{PLM Scoring} For re-ranking the text, we use an additional component for computing text fluency, which we refer to as \textsc{LMScorer}.
As described in \autoref{sec:evaluation}, we use perplexity of the text under a a \ac{plm}, computing the score of the output text $Y$ composed of tokens $(y_1, \ldots, y_n)$ as a geometric mean of the token conditional probability:
\begin{align}
    \operatorname{score}(Y) = \Bigg( \prod_{i=1}^{n}{P(y_i|y_1, \ldots, y_{i-1})} \Bigg)^{\frac{1}{n}}.
\end{align}




\paragraph{Generation Algorithm}
The input of the algorithm (\autoref{fig:iterative:alg}) is a set of $T$ ordered triples. First, we lexicalize the triple $x_0$ to get the output text $Y_0$ by filling the available templates and using the template with the best score from \textsc{LMScorer}.
% This promotes templates which sound more natural for particular values.
In each of the following steps $i=(1, \ldots, T-1)$, we lexicalize the triple $x_i$ and concatenate it with $Y_{i-1}$.  For improving the fluency of the text, we use the sentence fusion model with beam search to produce $k$ hypotheses. We filter and re-rank the hypotheses, getting $Y_{i}$ (see the next paragraph), and proceed to the next step. The output of the algorithm is the text $Y_{T-1}$ from the final step.


\paragraph{Filtering and Re-ranking} In each decoding step, we remove hypotheses in the beam missing any entity from the input data using a simple heuristic based on string matching. Next, we rescore the remaining hypotheses in the beam with \textsc{LMScorer} and set the hypothesis with the best score as $Y_{i}$. In case there are no sentences left in the beam after the filtering step, we let $Y_{i}$ be the text in which the lexicalized $x_i$ is appended after $Y_{i-1}$ without sentence fusion, ensuring the semantic accuracy of the text.

%For the E2E dataset, we first try to find a pair of predicates for which there is a template extracted from the data, and only use the handcrafted templates for the single predicates in the subsequent steps. 
%The final beam filtering step is a simple heuristic, checking if all entities from the input triples are present in the output.

    \label{tab:iterative:templates_ex}
\end{table}


\paragraph{Template Extraction} We experiment with the WebNLG and E2E datasets (see \autoref{sec:datasets}). For WebNLG, we extract the templates from the training examples containing only a \textit{single} triple. In the E2E dataset, there are no such examples; therefore we first extract the templates for \textit{pairs} of predicates, using them as a starting point for the algorithm in order to leverage the lexical variability in the data (manually filtering out the templates with semantic noise), and we also create a small set of templates for each \textit{single} predicate manually, using them in the subsequent steps of the algorithm.\footnote{In the E2E dataset, the data is in the form of key-value pairs. We transform the data to \ac{rdf} triples by using the name of the restaurant as a \textit{subject} and the rest of the pairs as \textit{predicate} and \textit{object}. This creates \textit{n-1} triples for \textit{n} pairs.} See \autoref{tab:iterative:templates_ex} for examples of templates we used in our experiments.

\paragraph{Sentence Fusion Model} We base our sentence fusion model on the text-editing model \textsc{LaserTagger} \cite{malmi2019lasertagger}. \textsc{LaserTagger} generates outputs by tagging inputs with edit operations (\texttt{KEEP} a token, \texttt{DELETE} a token, and \texttt{ADD} a phrase before the token), which makes it suitable for tasks where the output highly overlaps with the input. An important feature of \textsc{LaserTagger} is the limited size of its vocabulary, which consists of $l$ most frequent (possibly multi-token) phrases used to transform inputs to outputs in the training data. After the vocabulary is precomputed, all infeasible examples in the training data are filtered out. At the cost of limiting the number of training examples, this filtering makes the training data cleaner by removing outliers. The limited vocabulary also makes the model less prone to hallucinations errors.

\paragraph{LMScorer} As the \textsc{LMScorer} backend, we use the pre-trained GPT-2 language model \citep{radford2019language} from the Transformers repository\footnote{\url{https://github.com/huggingface/transformers}} \citep{wolf2019HuggingFacesTS}. We compute the perplexity scores using the \textit{lm-scorer}\footnote{\url{https://github.com/simonepri/lm-scorer}} package.

\subsection{Experiments}
\paragraph{Base Experiments} As a \emph{baseline}, we generate the best templates according to \textsc{LMScorer} without applying the sentence fusion (i.e., always using the fallback). For the \emph{sentence fusion} experiments, we use \textsc{LaserTagger} with the autoregressive decoder with a beam of size 10. We use all reference lexicalizations and the vocabulary size $V=100$, following our preliminary experiments. We finetune the model for 10,000 updates with batch size 32 and learning rate $2 \times 10^{-5}$.
For the beam filtering heuristic, we check for the presence of entities by simple string matching in WebNLG; for the E2E dataset, we use a set of regular expressions from \citet{dusekSemanticNoiseMatters2019}. We process the triples in their default order.

\paragraph{Zero-shot Experiment} Additionally, we conduct a \textit{zero-shot} experiment. We train the sentence fusion model with the same setup, but instead of the in-domain datasets, we use a subset of the balanced-Wikipedia portion of the \textsc{DiscoFuse} dataset \cite{geva-etal-2019-discofuse}. In particular, we use the discourse types which frequently occur in our datasets, filtering the discourse types which are not relevant for our use-case.

\end{table*}


\paragraph{Accuracy vs.\ Fluency}
The scores from the automatic metrics lag behind the state-of-the-art, although both the fusion and the zero-shot approaches show improvements over the baseline. Our approach ensures zero entity errors, since the entities are filled verbatim into the templates and in case an entity is missing in the whole beam, a fallback is used instead. Semantic inconsistencies still occur, e.g.\ if a verb or function words are missing.

The fused sentences in the E2E dataset, where all the objects are related to a single subject, often lean towards compact forms, e.g.: \textit{Aromi is a family friendly chinese coffee shop with a low customer rating in riverside}. On the contrary, the sentence structure in WebNLG mostly follows the structure from the templates and the model performs minimal changes to fuse the sentences together. See \autoref{tab:iterative:output} for examples of the system outputs. Out of all steps, 28\% are fallbacks (no fusion is performed) in WebNLG and 54\% in the E2E dataset. % v anglictine se za '\%' nedela mezera
The higher number of fallbacks in the E2E dataset can be explained by a higher lexical variability of the references, together with a higher number of data items per example in the E2E dataset, making it harder for the model to maintain the text coherency over multiple steps.

\paragraph{Templates} On average, there are 12.4 templates per predicate in WebNLG and 8.3 in the E2E dataset. In cases where the set of templates is more diverse, e.g.\ if the template for the predicate \textit{country} has to be selected from \{\textit{<subject> is situated within <object>, <subject> is a dish found in <object>}\}, \textsc{LMScorer} helps to select the semantically accurate template for the specific entities. The literal copying of entities can be too rigid in some cases, e.g.\ \textit{Atatürk Monument (İzmir) is made of ``Bronze''}, but these disfluencies can be improved in the fusion step.

\paragraph{Reordering} \textsc{LaserTagger} does not allow arbitrary reordering of words in the sentence, which can limit the expressiveness of the sentence fusion model. Consider the example in \autoref{fig:iterative:alg}: in order to create a sentence \textit{English is spoken in Dublin, the capital of Ireland}, the model has to delete and re-insert at least one of the entities, e.g.\ \textit{English}, which has to be present in the vocabulary.

\paragraph{Domain Independence} The zero-shot model trained on \textsc{DiscoFuse} is able to correctly pronominalize or delete repeated entities and join the sentences with conjunctives, e.g.\ \textit{William Anders was born in British Hong Kong\underline{, and was} a member of the crew of Apollo 8}. While the model makes only a limited use of sentence fusion, it makes the output more fluent while keeping strong guarantees of the output accuracy.

\subsection{Discussion}
% Building a high-quality sentence fusion model, which lies at the core of our approach, remains a challenge \cite{lebanoff2020learning}. Our simple extractive approach relying on existing D2T datasets may not produce sufficient amount of clean data. On the other hand, the phenomena covered in the \textsc{DiscoFuse} dataset are too narrow for the fully general sentence fusion. We believe that training the sentence fusion model on a larger and more diverse sentence fusion dataset, built e.g. in an unsupervised fashion \cite{lebanoff-etal-2019-scoring}, is a way to improve the robustness of our approach.

% Fluency of the output sentences may be also improved by allowing more flexibility for the order of entities, either by including an ordering step in the pipeline \citep{moryossef2019astep}, or by using a text-editing model that is capable of explicit reordering of words in the sentence \cite{mallinson2020felix}. Splitting the data into smaller batches (i.e. setting an upper bound for the number of sentences fused together) could also help to improve the consistency of results with a higher number of data items.

% Our string matching heuristic is quite crude and may lead to a high number of fallbacks. Introducing a more precise heuristic, such as a semantic fidelity classifier \citep{harkous2020have}, or a model trained for natural language inference \citep{dusek2020nli} could help to promote lexical variability of the text.

% Finally, we note that the text-editing paradigm allows to visualize the changes made by the model, introducing the option to accept or reject the changes at each step, and even build a set of custom rules on top of the individual edit operations based on the affected tokens. This flexibility could be useful for tweaking the model manually for a production system.


% \subsection{Conclusions}
% We proposed a simple and intuitive approach for D2T generation, splitting the process into two steps: lexicalization of data and improving the text fluency. A trivial lexicalization helps to promote fidelity and domain independence while delegating the subtle work with language to neural models allows to benefit from the power of general-domain pre-training. While a straightforward application of this approach on the WebNLG and E2E datasets does not produce state-of-the-art results in terms of automatic metrics, the results still show considerable improvements above the baseline. We provided insights into the behavior of the model, highlighted its potential benefits, and proposed the directions for further improvements.


\section{Pipeline of Text-to-Text Neural Modules}
\label{sec:pipeline}
\begin{refbox}
    This section is based on the paper \emph{Neural Pipeline for Zero-Shot Data-to-Text Generation} \cite{kasner2022neural}, joint work with Ondřej Dušek, published in the Proceedings of the 60th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL 2022).
\end{refbox}

In this section, we further develop the approach from \autoref{sec:iterative} for generating semantically accurate text from structured data. The main limitation of the previous approach, which was based on iterative transformations of simple templates, was the limited fluency of the output texts. To improve text fluency, we propose adding ordering and aggregation, making the process a three-step pipeline. We also propose a way to make each of these steps trainable on a generic synthetic corpus. We confirm that on WebNLG and E2E dataset, our approach can get lower rates of omissions and hallucinations than prior approaches according to a semantic accuracy metric, while achieving levels of lexical similarity comparable to some of the prior systems; all of this without the need for in-domain training data. Our code and data is available on Github.\footnote{\url{https://github.com/kasnerz/zeroshot-d2t-pipeline}}

% an approach for transforming the templates based on a sequence of modules trained on general-domain text-based operations: ordering, aggregation, and paragraph compression. We train \acp{plm} for performing these operations on a synthetic corpus \textsc{WikiFluent} which we build from English Wikipedia. Our experiments on WebNLG and E2E show that our approach enables \ac{d2t} generation from \ac{rdf} triples in zero-shot settings. Our code and data is available on Github.\footnote{\url{https://github.com/kasnerz/zeroshot-d2t-pipeline}}

\subsection{Motivation}
Our experiments in \autoref{sec:iterative} with iterative sentence fusion led to several observations:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The fixed order of triples limits the expressivity of the model, leading to unnatural outputs.
    \item Using the sentence fusion model on every sentence boundary tends to produce sentences which are too compact.
    \item Text-editing models underperform state-of-the-art autoregressive models in terms of output quality \cite{kaleTexttoTextPreTrainingDatatoText2020,ribeiroInvestigatingPretrainedLanguage2020}.
\end{enumerate}

Following these observations, we improve our approach by (1) inserting a triple-ordering step in the process, (2) replacing the sentence fusion by paragraph compression, and (3) basing the approach on trainable autoregressive models.


Our approach follows the idea of pipeline-based approaches (see \autoref{sec:d2t-pipeline}). In particular, our pipeline follow the idea of pipelines based on iterative improvements of simple templates  \cite{laha2020scalable} and neural modules \cite{ferreiraNeuralDatatotextGeneration2019}. We focus on the \emph{ordering} and \emph{aggregation} steps, which were shown to improve the quality of \ac{d2t} generation outputs in domain-specific setups \cite{moryossef2019improving,moryossef2019step,trisedyaSentenceGenerationEntity2020,su2021plan}.

In contrast to previous approaches, our pipeline is fully trainable on general-domain data, i.e., without using any training data from target \ac{d2t} datasets. By eliminating the need for human references, we get rid of the costly and time-consuming reference collection process. At the same time, we also avoid the brittleness of few-shot approaches, which are sensitive to the choice of finetuning examples \cite{chenFewShotNLGPreTrained2019,suFewShotTabletoTextGeneration2021,changSelectGenChallengeFinding2021}.

\subsection{Method}
\label{sec:pipeline:method}
\begin{figure}[t]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/zeroshot_pipeline.pdf}
    \caption{A scheme of our approach for zero-shot data-to-text generation from RDF triples. After a simple transformation of triples to facts, we apply the pipeline of modules for (1) ordering, (2) aggregation, (3) paragraph compression. Individual modules are trained on a large general-domain text corpus and operate over text in natural language. In-domain knowledge is included only in the simple hand-crafted templates for each predicate.}\label{fig:zeroshot:pipeline}
\end{figure}
Here, we provide the formal description of our approach. Similarly to \Cref{sec:finetuning,sec:iterative}, we focus on the task of producing a natural language description $Y$ a set of \ac{rdf} triples $x \in X$, where each triple $x = (s, p, o)$ describes the relation $p$ between the entities $s$ and $o$ in the knowledge graph.

Given a set of triples $X$ on the input, we:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item transform the triples into \textit{facts}, which are short sentences in natural language,
    \item sort the facts using an \textit{ordering} module,
    \item insert sentence delimiters between the sorted facts using an \textit{aggregation} module,
    \item input the ordered sequence of facts with delimiters into a \textit{paragraph compression} module, which generates the final description $Y$.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Transforming Triples to Facts}

The first step in our pipeline involves transforming each of the input triples $x \in X$ into a fact $f \in F$  using a transformation $T: X \rightarrow F$. We define a fact $f$ as a single sentence in natural language describing $x$.
The transformation serves two purposes: (a) preparing the data for the subsequent text-to-text operations, (b) introducing in-domain knowledge about the semantics of individual predicates.


% This step can be realized e.g. using a simple template for each predicate (cf. §\ref{sec:templates_model}).
% Several neural methods for this task were proposed, using either interactions between pairs of sentences \cite{chen2016neural,li2017neural}, global interactions \cite{gong2016end,wang2019hierarchical}, or combination of both \cite{cui2020bert}. We base our ordering module (§\ref{sec:ord_model}) on the recent work of \citet{calizzano2021ordering}, who use a pointer network \cite{wang2019hierarchical,vinyals2015pointer} on top of a PLM.


\paragraph{Ordering} We assume that the default order of triples $X$ is random. Note, however, that $F$ is a set of meaningful sentences. We can use this to our advantage and apply a sentence ordering module \cite{barzilay2001sentence,lapata2003probabilistic} maximize the coherency of the paragraph resulting from their concatenation. The sentence ordering module $O(F)$ produces an ordered sequence of facts: $F_o = \{f_{o_1}, \ldots, f_{o_n}\}$, where $o_{1:n}$ is a permutation of fact indices. An example outcome of such operation may be grouping together facts mentioning \textit{birth date} and \textit{birth place} of a person, followed by their \textit{occupation}, as it is shown in \autoref{fig:zeroshot:pipeline}. The ordering module allows downstream modules to only focus on operations over neighboring sentences.


\paragraph{Aggregation} Some facts will be typically mentioned together in a single sentence. Considering the previous example, \textit{occupation} is likely to be mentioned separately, while \textit{birth date} and \textit{birth place} are likely to be mentioned together. We make these decisions using the aggregation module, which takes a sequence of ordered facts $F_o$ as input and produces a sequence of sentence delimiters $A(F_o) = \{\delta_{o_1}, \delta_{o_2}, \ldots, \delta_{o_{n-1}}\}$; $\delta_{i} \in \{0, 1\}$.
% The output $\delta_{i}=1$ means that the neighboring facts should be mentioned separately, i.e. the neighboring sentences should \textit{not} be fused. Conversely, 
Unlike previous works \cite{wiseman2018learning,shao-etal-2019-long,shen-etal-2020-neural,xuAGGGENOrderingAggregating2021}, which capture the segments corresponding to individual parts of the input as latent variables, we simply insert delimiters into the ordered sequence of facts to mark sentence boundaries. The output $\delta_{i}=0$ means that the facts should be aggregated and their corresponding sentences should be fused. Note that the markers serve only a hint for the paragraph compression module, i.e., the sentences are not fused in this step.



\paragraph{Paragraph Compression}  The \ac{pc} module takes as input the ordered sequence of facts with delimiters $F_a = \{f_{o_1}, \delta_{o_1}, f_{o_2}, \ldots, \delta_{o_{n-1}}, f_{o_n}\}$ and produces the final text $Y$.  It has two main objectives: (a) \textit{fusing} related sentences, i.e., sentences $i$ and $j$ in between which $\delta_{i}=0$, and (b) \textit{rephrasing} the text to improve its fluency, e.g., fixing disfluencies in the templates or replacing noun phrases with refering expressions. Unlike in text summarization or sentence simplification, the edits will typically be minor, since we aim to preserve the semantics of the text.



\subsection{\textsc{WikiFluent} Corpus}
\label{sec:pipeline:wikifluent}
For training the modules, we need to build a corpus in which (1) the input is a set of simple, template-like sentences, (2) the output is a fluent text in natural language preserving the semantics of the input. Here, we propose a way how to build such a large-scale synthetic corpus from English Wikipedia. Our resulting corpus (\textsc{WikiFluent}) is orders of magnitude larger than the in-domain \ac{d2t} datasets and provides training data for all the modules in our pipeline.

% we collect a large-scale synthetic corpus \textsc{WikiFluent}. Our goal is to build a corpus covering a broad range of domains and capturing the sentence style in D2T generation. In other words, we . As we describe below in detail, we achieve that by using human-written paragraphs in English Wikipedia and applying \textit{split-and-rephrase} and  \textit{coreference resolution} models to obtain synthetic source texts. The process is illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:wikifluent}; corpus statistics are included in Appendix \ref{app:stats}.

\paragraph{Data Source} For building the \textsc{WikiFluent} corpus, we first extracted 934k first paragraphs of articles from a Wikipedia dump\footnote{\texttt{enwiki-20210401-pages-articles-multistream}} using WikiExtractor \cite{Wikiextractor2015}. Wikipedia is commonly used for large-scale pretraining of D2T generation models, as it provides a source of neutral texts based on factual data \cite{jinGenWikiDatasetMillion2020,chenKGPTKnowledgeGroundedPreTraining2020}.
% Although it is not bias-free, it provides more balanced sample of natural language use than typical D2T generation datasets. 
We used the first paragraphs of Wikipedia entries with length between 30-430 characters; filtering out lists, disambiguations, and malformed paragraphs. To balance the length of inputs, we divided the paragraphs according to their length into 4 equally-sized bins (30-130 characters, etc.) and selected 250k examples from each bin.

\paragraph{Split-and-Rephrase} Split-and-rephrase is a task of splitting a complex sentence into a sequence of shorter sentences preserving the original meaning \citep{narayan-etal-2017-split}. We train\footnote{Following the same setup as for a paragraph compression model (\autoref{sec:pipeline:implementation}).} BART-base \cite{lewisBARTDenoisingSequencetoSequence2019} for the split-and-rephrase task on the WikiSplit corpus, containing human-made sentence splits from Wikipedia edit history \cite{botha-etal-2018-learning}.  We split each paragraph into sentences using NLTK \cite{bird2006nltk} and apply the split-and-rephrase model on each sentence. To ensure that the splits are not deterministic, we choose uniformly randomly choosing between 0-2 recursive calls. If the sentence cannot be meaningfully split, the model tends to duplicate the sentence on the output; in that case, we use only the original sentence and do not proceed with the splitting.


%  apply a \textit{split-and-rephrase} on each sentence in our paragraph paragraph into sentences and apply a  model on each sentence.  To generate a set of simple template-like sentences from the Wikipedia paragraphs, we divide each  The process is illustrated in the upper part of Figure \ref{fig:wikifluent}.



\paragraph{Coreference Replacement} Unlike the templates, which always mention a single fact, the split sentences will heavily use referring expressions. To match the sentence style, we apply a coreference resolution model \cite{Lee2018HigherorderCR} from the AllenNLP framework \cite{gardner2018allennlp}. We use the model in order to replace referring expressions with their antencendents (e.g., pronouns with noun phrases). Note that we replace the referring expressions only in the synthesized sentences, not in the original paragraphs, so that the paragraph compression module is later implicitly trained to generate referring expressions in the final description.

\paragraph{Filtering} To ensure that the generated sentences convey the same semantics as the original paragraph, we use a pretrained RoBERTa model\footnote{\url{https://huggingface.co/roberta-large-mnli}} \cite{liuRoBERTaRobustlyOptimized2019} trained on the MultiNLI dataset \cite{williams2018mnli} for checking the semantic accuracy of the generated text. Following \citet{dusekEvaluatingSemanticAccuracy2020}, we test if the original paragraph entails each of the synthesized sentences (checking for omissions), and if the set of concatenated synthesized sentences entails the original paragraph (checking for hallucinations). In a filtered version of the \textsc{WikiFluent} corpus, we include only the examples without omissions or hallucinations (as computed by the model), reducing it to 714k examples (approximately 75\% of the original size).

\subsection{Implementation}
\label{sec:pipeline:implementation}

In this section, we describe how we implement our pipeline modules using simple template transformations and neural models trained on the \textsc{WikiFluent} dataset.

\begin{figure*}[t]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/pipeline-variants.pdf}

    \caption{An example illustrating how the individual modules are trained and subsequently applied as the parts of the pipeline. See \autoref{sec:pipeline:implementation} for the description of the ordering model (\textsc{ord}), the aggregation model (\textsc{agg}), and the variants of the paragraph compression model (\textsc{PC, PC+agg, PC+ord+agg}).}
    \label{fig:pipeline:variants}
\end{figure*}

\paragraph{Templates}
We transform triples into facts using a single-triple template $t_i$ for each predicate, analogically to our approach in \autoref{sec:iterative:implementation}. Compared to more complex rule-based template generation engines \cite{laha2020scalable,heidari2021getting,mehta2021improving}, the approach minimizes manual workload and makes it easier to control the quality of the input for the subsequent steps.

\paragraph{Ordering Model}
For our ordering model, we use the \emph{Simple Pointer} model from \citet{calizzano2021ordering}\footnote{For details about the model, please refer to \citet{calizzano2021ordering}}. The model is based on a pretrained BART-base model \cite{lewisBARTDenoisingSequencetoSequence2019} extended with a pointer network from \citet{wang2019hierarchical}. We train the model using the synthesized simple sentences in the \textsc{WikiFluent} corpus, randomly shuffling the order of the sentences and training the model to restore their original order.

% In the encoding phase, facts $F$ are concatenated and tokenized. Each fact is surrounded by special tokens denoting the beginning (\texttt{<s>}) and the end (\texttt{</s>}) of the fact. The sequence is processed by the BART encoder, generating a sequence of encoder states $E$ for each end token \texttt{</s>} representing the preceding fact.

% The decoding proceeds autoregressively. To bootstrap the decoding process, the pair of tokens \texttt{<s></s>} is fed into the decoder, producing the decoder state $d_1$. The pointer network (attending to $d_1$ and $E$), selects the first ordered fact $f_{o_1}$, which is fed into the decoder in the next step ($d_2 = $\texttt{<s>$f_{o_1}$</s>}). The process is repeated until the all the facts are decoded in a particular order.

% The pointer network computes the probability of a fact to be on the $j$-th position, using the encoder output $E$ and the decoder output state $d_j$. The network is based on the scaled dot product attention, where $d_j$ is the query and encoder outputs $E_i$ are the keys:
% \begin{gather*}
%     Q = d_j W_Q \\
%     K = E W_K \\
%     P_{j} = \operatorname{softmax}\left(\frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{b}}\right).
% \end{gather*}
% Here $W_Q$ and $W_K \in \mathbb{R}^{b\times b}$, $b$ is the dimension of BART hidden states, and $P_{j} \in \mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ is the probability distribution for the $j$-th position (i.e., $P_{ji}$ is the probability that fact $f_i$ is on the $j$-th position).



\paragraph{Aggregation Model}
We base our aggregation model on RoBERTa-large \cite{liuRoBERTaRobustlyOptimized2019} with a token classification head. We input the sequence of ordered facts $F_o$ into the model, separating each pair of facts $f_{o_i}$ with a separator token. The token classification layer classifies each separator token into two classes $\{0,1\}$ corresponding to the delimiter $\delta_i$. We ignore the outputs for the non-separator tokens while computing cross-entropy loss. We create the training examples using the synthesized sentences in the \textsc{WikiFluent} corpus, in which we set $\delta_i=0$ for the sentences $i,i+1$ which were originally aggregated (i.e., are the result of splitting a single sentence) and $\delta_i=1$ otherwise.

\paragraph{Paragraph Compression Model} For the paragraph compression model, we finetune BART-base \cite{lewisBARTDenoisingSequencetoSequence2019} on the \textsc{WikiFluent} corpus, concatenating the synthesized sentences on the input. We add delimiters between the sentences $i$ and $i+1$ where $\delta_i=1$ using a special token \texttt{<sep>}, which we add to the model vocabulary. We expect that the model will learn to fuse the sentences between which there are no delimiters on the input. We evaluate how the model learns to respect the order and aggregation markers in \autoref{sec:pipeline:eval}.


\subsection{Experiments}
\label{sec:pipeline:experiments}
We train our pipeline modules on the \textsc{WikiFluent} corpus as described in \autoref{sec:pipeline:implementation}. Next, we use these modules \textit{without any further finetuning} for generating descriptions for RDF triples on the WebNLG and E2E datasets.

\paragraph{Pipeline versions} In order to evaluate individual components of our pipeline, we train three versions of the \textit{paragraph compression} model. The models share the same architecture and targets, but differ in their inputs:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textsc{\ac{pc}} -- the model takes as an input ordered facts with delimiters (as described in \autoref{sec:pipeline:method}),
    \item \textsc{\ac{pc}+agg} -- the model takes as an input ordered facts \textit{without} delimiters (i.e., the aggregation is left implicitly to the model),
    \item \textsc{\ac{pc}+ord+agg} -- the model takes as an input facts in \textit{random} order and \textit{without} delimiters (i.e., both ordering and aggregation are left implicitly to the model).
\end{itemize}
Correspondingly, we test three versions of the pipeline for the \textbf{ablation study}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textsc{3-stage} -- a full version of the pipeline consisting of the ordering model (\textsc{ord}), the aggregation model (\textsc{agg}) and the \textsc{\ac{pc}} model,
    \item \textsc{2-stage} -- a pipeline consisting of the \textsc{ord} model and the \textsc{\ac{pc}+agg} model,
    \item \textsc{1-stage} -- a single stage consisting of the \textsc{\ac{pc}+ord+agg} model.
\end{itemize}
We evaluate all versions of the pipeline with PC models trained on the \textit{full} and \textit{filtered} versions of the \textsc{WikiFluent} dataset (see §\ref{sec:pipeline:wikifluent}).


\subsection{Evaluation}
\label{sec:pipeline:eval}
We evaluate outputs from the \textsc{\{1,2,3\}-stage} variants of our pipeline using automatic metrics, and we perform a detailed manual error analysis of the model outputs. We also evaluate the performance of the content planning modules and the ability of the PC module to follow the content plan. Finally, we include an intrinsic evaluation of our modules on the \textsc{WikiFluent} test set.

We include a diverse set of baselines for comparison. \baselinecopy{} denotes the baseline of copying the facts without further processing. For WebNLG, we further compare our systems with the results of:
\begin{itemize}
    \item UPF-FORGe and \textsc{Melbourne} -- systems (grammar-based and supervised, respectively) from the first run of WebNLG Challenge \cite{gardentWebNLGChallengeGenerating2017},
    \item  \citet{keJointGTGraphTextJoint2021} -- a state-of-the-art system with a structure-aware encoder and task-specific pretraining,
    \item \citet{laha2020scalable} -- a zero-shot D2T generation system.
\end{itemize}
For E2E, we compare our systems with the results of:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textsc{TGen} \cite{dusekTrainingNaturalLanguage2015} -- the baseline system for the E2E Challenge \cite{dusekEvaluatingStateoftheartEndtoEnd2020},
    \item \citet{harkousHaveYourText2020} -- a state-of-the-art supervised system on the cleaned version of E2E data.
\end{itemize}

The automatic evaluation (\autoref{tab:pipeline:auto}) shows that our systems consistently outperform the \baselinecopy{} baseline (e.g., $\sim$12 BLEU points for E2E), which is already strong thanks to our manually curated set of templates.\footnote{On WebNLG, \baselinecopy{} achieves 37.18 BLEU points, compared to 24.80 BLEU points of the \textit{full system} of \citet{laha2020scalable}, which uses automatic template generation.} Automatic scores also suggest that our systems are comparable with some older supervised systems, although it underperforms the state-of-the-art supervised systems.

The \textsc{2-stage} system is generally on par with the \textsc{3-stage} system, which indicates that explicit aggregation using the \textsc{agg} model may not be necessary. However, a separate aggregation module allows to control the aggregation step explicitly. The models using the filtered version of the corpus generally produce better results, although they also bring in a larger number of omissions.

    \caption{Number of manually annotated errors on 100 examples: H = hallucinations, I = incorrect fact merging, O = omissions, R = redundancies, G = grammar errors or disfluencies.}
    \label{tab:pipeline:manual}
\end{table}
We manually examined 100 outputs of the model, counting the number of factual (hallucinations, omissions, incorrect fact merging, redundancies) and grammatical errors. The results are summarized in Table \ref{tab:pipeline:manual}.
The \textsc{1-stage} model (which has to order the facts implicitly) tends to repeat the facts in the text (especially in E2E) and produces frequent hallucinations. These problems are largely eliminated with the \textsc{2-stage} and \textsc{3-stage} models, which produce almost no hallucinations or omissions.
However, the outputs on WebNLG for all systems suffer from semantic errors resulting from merging of unrelated facts. This mostly happens with unrelated predicates connected to the same subject/object (e.g.\ “X was born in Y”, “X worked as Z” expressed as “X worked as Z in Y”). On the E2E data, where predicates share the same subject, the outputs are generally consistent and the \textsc{2-stage} and \textsc{3-stage} models exhibit almost no semantic errors. Grammar errors and disfluencies stem mainly from over-eager paragraph compression or from artifacts in our templates and are relatively minor (e.g., missing “is” in “serves French food and family-friendly”).


\paragraph{Content Planning} We manually evaluate how the \ac{pc} model follows the content plan (i.e., keeping the predefined order and aggregating the sentences according to the delimiters) using 100 randomly chosen examples with more than 1 triple on WebNLG and E2E. We find that the model follows the content plan in 95\% and 100\% of cases, respectively. The incorrect cases include mostly a fact not properly mentioned or an extra boundary between sentences without a separator. We can thus conclude that the pretraining task successfully teaches the PC model to follow a given content plan.


% Following \citet{su2021plan} and \citet{zhao2020bridging}, we report the accuracy and BLEU-2 score of our \textbf{ordering model} on WebNLG against the human-generated plans from \citet{ferreira2018enriching}. The results are listed in Table \ref{tab:cp} and compared against a \textsc{random} baseline (random ordering) and prior work. The results show that although our approach again lags behind state-of-the-art supervised approaches, it can outperform both the random baseline and the Transformer-based approach from \citet{ferreira2019neural} while not using any in-domain examples.

% We also evaluate the accuracy of our \textbf{aggregation model}, using triples ordered according to the plans from \citet{ferreira2018enriching} as input. The accuracy is 0.33 per example and 0.62 per sentence boundary (random baseline is 0.23 and 0.50, respectively). The results show that although our approach is better than the random baseline, there is still room for improvement.

% Finally, 

% \paragraph{Intrinsic Evaluation} We also provide evaluation of our pipeline modules on the \mbox{\textsc{WikiFluent}} test sets. We evaluated the ordering, aggregation, and paragraph compression modules trained on the \textit{full} \textsc{WikiFluent} corpus. The results for both \textit{full} and \textit{filtered} test sets are summarized in Table \ref{tab:wikifluent_test}. The PC model achieves high scores, which follows from the fact that we provide it with ground truth content plans (i.e., the ordering and aggregation plan corresponding to the original paragraph). Accuracy of the ordering and aggregation modules is comparable to their performance on D2T datasets.
