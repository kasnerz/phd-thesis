Academic freedom is a moral and legal concept expressing the conviction that
the freedom of inquiry by faculty members is essential to the mission of the
academy as well as the principles of academia, and that scholars should have
freedom to teach or communicate ideas or facts (including those that are
inconvenient to external political groups or to authorities) without fear of
repression, job loss, or imprisonment.

capacity - as teachers or researchers expressing strictly scholarly viewpoints
-, an expansive interpretation extends these occupational safeguards to
scholars' speech on matters outside their professional expertise.

It is a type of freedom of speech.
