  abstract = {Earlier research has shown that few studies in
              Natural Language Generation (NLG) evaluate their
              system outputs using an error analysis, despite known
              limitations of automatic evaluation metrics and human
              ratings. This position paper takes the stance that
              error analyses should be encouraged, and discusses
              several ways to do so. This paper is not just based
              on our shared experience as authors, but we also
              distributed a survey as a means of public
              consultation. We provide an overview of existing
              barriers to carry out error analyses, and proposes
              changes to improve error reporting in the NLG
              literature.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we present a Multi-Task Deep Neural Network (MT-DNN) for learning representations across multiple natural language understanding (NLU) tasks. MT-DNN not only leverages large amounts of cross-task data, but also benefits from a regularization effect that leads to more general representations to help adapt to new tasks and domains. MT-DNN extends the model proposed in Liu et al. (2015) by incorporating a pre-trained bidirectional transformer language model, known as BERT (Devlin et al., 2018). MT-DNN obtains new state-of-the-art results on ten NLU tasks, including SNLI, SciTail, and eight out of nine GLUE tasks, pushing the GLUE benchmark to 82.7{\%} (2.2{\%} absolute improvement) as of February 25, 2019 on the latest GLUE test set. We also demonstrate using the SNLI and SciTail datasets that the representations learned by MT-DNN allow domain adaptation with substantially fewer in-domain labels than the pre-trained BERT representations. Our code and pre-trained models will be made publicly available.}
