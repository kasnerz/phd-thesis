@article{van_miltenburg_barriers_2023,
  abstract = {Earlier research has shown that few studies in
              Natural Language Generation (NLG) evaluate their
              system outputs using an error analysis, despite known
              limitations of automatic evaluation metrics and human
              ratings. This position paper takes the stance that
              error analyses should be encouraged, and discusses
              several ways to do so. This paper is not just based
              on our shared experience as authors, but we also
              distributed a survey as a means of public
              consultation. We provide an overview of existing
              barriers to carry out error analyses, and proposes
              changes to improve error reporting in the NLG
              literature.},
