Dominik (2024) got template from Dušan (2022). Dominik updated title page (we're not on
``Specialization: Mathematical Linguistics'' anymore), he added his
favorite macros and some fixes. There was Makefile from Dušan. Dominik cleaned
and documented it a bit and commited into Jindra H.'s repo.

Dušan used Jindra H.'s template. 

Jindra H. made the repo \url{https://github.com/ufal/phd-thesis-template} in 2022.
